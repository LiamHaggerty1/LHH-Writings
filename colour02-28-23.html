                        <p>I always saw things in black and white. The world, constantly dull to the point where it bored
                            me. But why should it? To this day, I never understood. My life wasn’t bad. Looking back on my time in high school, it was enticing. Captain of the baseball team, honor student, and all around charismatic guy. However, at the time I didn’t see it that way. Dull, blank high school walls was all I saw. Life was void of color. Until she came in.</p>
                        <p>Humans can often pinpoint memories, where they can paint every moment to the exact detail. This was one of my most vivid memories, a stamp marking the start of the rest of my life. It was mid-September, just about a week after school started. It was a Monday, my eyes barely open not ready for the week. The first bell left my ears ringing, once again signifying the start of home room. I sat in the desk one from the back. The stinging light from bright bulbs illuminated the grey classroom. I leaned back and groaned, not ready for the day ahead of me. My homeroom teacher, Ms. Moon walked in at a sharp 8:02 like she always did. Except this time, she was leading a student. I didn’t recognize her. She walked in slowly, a confident stride through the classroom door. But I noticed something I hadn’t noticed before. She was glowing. Not in a beauty sense, but I could see a bright aura around her. It was a bright yellow. I could feel my pupils dilate at the sight of the color. I hadn’t seen it before. Like a deer in the headlights, my vision focused on her. For the first time in my life, I could see color.</p>
                        <p>As I was gathering my thoughts, Ms. Moon caught the class’s attention with a loud “Good Morning class.” Everyone stopped their side conversations, now curious as who this mystery person was. She was now standing in the front of the class, her deep purple bag slung over her shoulder which held her bright orange notebook labeled “NOTES” in all capital letters. “This is our new student, Emilia. Everyone be kind and treat her as one of our own.”
                            Ms. Moon gestured at Emilia, as if to say “introduce yourself.” Her bright blues eyes darted around the classroom, as a smile filled her face revealing her bright white teeth.
                            “Hi, my name is Emilia.”</p>
                        <p>Her five words shocked the class due to her British accent. Whispers filled the room, each student surely talking about how a British person, foreign to many, transferred into our school. Oddly enough, she ended her introduction and started to walk through the rows of desks to find an open seat, leaving each individual in the homeroom wanting more info on this individual now known as Emilia.</p>
                        <p>The only open desk in the room, right next to me was ripe for the taking. As she got closer to the open desk, I could see more of her now. The bright yellow aura was still there, still leaving me in shock. She had smooth, brown hair that glistened in the light. Everything about her was colorful, and I couldn’t explain why.
                            “Do you mind if I sit here?”</p>
                        <p>She said, once again with that beautiful smile. I hesitated for a moment, not quite sure how to respond to this new burst of colour in my life. But before I could say anything, she took a seat next to me, her colourful aura seeming to envelop me as well. As the class went on, I found myself stealing glances at her, trying to understand what made her so different. And as the days, weeks and months went on, I began to realize that it wasn't just her physical appearance that was
                            so vibrant. Emilia had a way of seeing the world that I had never even considered before. She saw beauty and excitement in the smallest things, and her enthusiasm was infectious.</p>
                        <p>Slowly but surely, Emilia began to bring colour into my life in a way that I never thought possible. We became fast friends, and soon I found myself looking forward to each new day, eager to see what new adventures she would take me on. She showed me that there was so much more to life than just going through the motions, and that the world was full of colour and excitement if only we were willing to see it.</p>
                        <p>Our favorite adventures were always after school. We walked along the empty halls, Emilia splashing colour with every step. She didn’t see the rainbow, but I saw it all the time. We climbed the vacant staircase all the way to the top floor and ended up in alumni hall, where students would sleep in the morning and study during the day. We slide open the large sliding doors, exposing the porch that overlooked the upper bay. To our left we could see the Verrazano bridge, which I explained was the largest suspension bridge on the east coast. To our right we could catch a glimpse of downtown Manhattan, where I promised her to take her to Wall Street and show her the raging bull. I promised to take her to the freedom tower, which was the tallest building in North America. I promised to take her to times square, where my favorite store, the m&m store, is located. We talked and talked, everything she seemed to mention or point out, she added colour to. She pointed out the sky, talking about how colourful it was. When I looked up, it turned bright blue. She mentioned she could see the Staten Island ferry and when I looked at the port it was now that famous orange paint which navy blue letters across the side. She noticed things I didn’t. She pointed out the bright side of everything, which gave new meaning to the word “vibrant.”</p>
                        <p>We would walk up 69th street in Bay Ridge, eventually making our way up to 3rd Ave, where our favorite pizza place was, where we would talk about our dreams and career aspirations. She would point out how busy New York was. We would people watch, giving each person their own story. For every person we point out their colour changed. Bland dull jackets turned bright blue when we noticed them. Baseball caps turned orange, shoes lit up, and shirts vibrated the brightest colours I have ever seen.</p>
                        <p>The colour of my clothes started to change as well, all my hoodies turned to different colours of the rainbow, red, blue, orange, yellow. Soon, my shoes followed. My phone case was now bright orange, a constant reminder of the first time I met Emilia. Any bad news was now treated with a positive side spun by Emilia. Any bad grade I received was followed with positive words from her. Negatives couldn’t win.</p>
                        <p>Looking back now, I can hardly believe how much my life has changed since Emilia walked into that homeroom. Eventually she had to transferred elsewhere, but even though she had only been in my life for a year, she changed the way I view the world. She made me see the colour in everything in life. And for that, I will be eternally grateful.</p>
