                        <p>Standing on the platform, the train blew past blowing the uncomfortable but familiar hot air of the city. My eyes watery and exhausted from the day. As I let everyone out, I could hear the conversations, but not focus on one. I could feel the emotions but understand none. I stepped off the platform into the old, rugged metal car. The inside was vacant, only a few passengers on board. I sat down. I had done this routine a hundred times before, but tonight felt empty. The only way to describe it. Almost 9 million people in this city, yet why did I feel like the only one? </p>
                        <p>	“Hey, can I ask you a question?”
                            I glanced over to find a younger woman curiously looking at me. She had dirty blonde curly hair with bright green eyes. A yellow, plaid skirt with a green blouse to match. An unusual combo, but who was I to judge. Fairly confused, I hesitated before I answered.</p>
                        <p>	“Uh… sure? I guess so?” I managed to spit out.
                            I was not in the mood for any kind of conversation, but I obliged against my initial will. 
                                “Do you believe that people are born better than others?” She said with a small smirk.
                                “Do I what?”
                                “Do you think people are born better than others? Yes or no.” She repeated herself cheerfully.</p>
                        <p>Tired and unwilling, I didn’t want to continue this conversation. I merely wanted it to end. 
                            “I guess I would say so, yes.” I replied
                        She looked at me with an odd expression. I couldn’t tell what she was feeling. I couldn’t read her very well at all. She proceeded with her conversation.
                            “Well, I believe—”
                        “Look, lady I don’t want to be rude, but after the day I had, I am not in the mood for any discussion on the philosophy of the world.” </p>
                        <p>I was never a mean person, but the wave of emotions pushed me to cut her off before she could finish. There was a long pause. Her smile dropped and eyes fell to the floor. I expected her to be mad, throw angry emotions at me, just anything. I was waiting for the wrath to start, but nothing happened. It was now quiet on the subway, just us sitting across from each other on an empty train. In a calm, quiet voice, she began to say:
                            “That is exactly what I’m here for.”</p>
                        <p>I was confused by this statement, and once again a long pause filled the still air of the subway car. 
                            “What do you mean?” My voice, shaky when I uttered the question. Her tone turned serious, picking up her head replying:</p>
                        <p>“You often believe certain people are better than you. That those you admire somehow were born with gifts you so struggle to attain. You see it in your close friends, that they are somehow just lucky to achieve their goals. You see it in your employers, that they are born with the talent to move up in the world. You see it in your father, that he is the reason you are cursed. These people were all born equal. The way they are set apart is not because of their circumstances, but because of the realization that success is not lucky, nor does it require talent given, but rather the product of hard work. So now, I want you to answer a different question: Can you become better than others?”</p>
                        <p>The woman was looking at me with the same smile she had on before. I could now get a good look at her face. The only word I could use was innocent. The way her hair fell onto her face, her eyes, a bright blue color like I was staring into the sea on a small boat, so much so that I could not utter another word. This sight filled me with a sense of peace and belonging in this world. Her words comforted me like a warm blanket on a cold winter night. My thoughts were still catching up with the sentence, as I was carefully analyzing the situation in front of me. I’m sure she saw the gears turning in my head as I was comprehending her speech. I prepared to open my mouth to utter an excuse for an answer, but when I blinked, she was gone. Concerned, I looked around the subway car. I couldn’t find her anywhere. Almost as if she was never there.</p>
                        <p>Did I hallucinate the whole thing? I thought to myself.
                            The broken sound of the speaker said it was my stop. I stepped off the platformed confused. Maybe she was there, maybe she wasn’t. But she left me with a feeling I had never felt before. It felt as if the solution to my problems were mapped out in front of me. Climbing out of the station into the atmosphere of the never-sleeping city, I knew what I had to accomplish. 
                            Can I become a better person?</p>
