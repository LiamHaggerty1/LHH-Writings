            <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>I awoke to the sounds of leaves falling, each one making a distinct sound as it fell off the tree. I left the window open last night. I looked around. Took in my surroundings. Same day as it always was. The room, cold and empty. Like a hollow shell without any trace of being. The walls were blank, a faded eggshell white. Nothing has changed. I shifted my line of sight to the single window on the far side of the room. I could now tell it was autumn. That unique smell, radiating off the trees that once had beautiful bright green leaves. Now, a weak sense of life ever being there. After lying on the poorly made bed with cheap sheets, I arose from the comfortable position I was in. I looked over at the clock. 6:33am. Each day started earlier and earlier. </p>
                        <p>I made my way over to the bathroom, ready to start the day. The routine was similar. Nothing has changed. That’s when I noticed my hands. I stopped for a second. I didn’t recognize them. These weren’t the hands of the person I had once known. I see that I am changing. Things had changed. But why does it feel like I am falling behind? Unease passed over me as I was now in the middle of the hallway staring at these hands that I once thought could change the world. It seemed like a distant dream I once had. The pathetic realization knowing that time had passed. These hands were unable to achieve the goals I had set out for myself when I was younger. </p>
                        <p>Concerned, I continued my way to the bathroom. As I set to get ready for the day, I glanced in the mirror. I had yet to turn on the lights, so the only illumination was the barely visible sunrise outside the bathroom window. As the light shadowed over me, it was now fully visible in the mirror. It was me? Yes, it was. I had to reassure myself that this was the person I was looking at. Like my hands, I didn’t recognize the person staring at me. Those eyes. Attached to a face. It was my face. I knew it was my face. I knew it was the face that everyone on the street sees. Recognized as a real person. But it was a stranger to me. The deep brown eyes that were once full of optimism and hope, now replaced by regret and apathy. I didn’t recognize those eyes. The face. The face wasn’t smiling. I could remember it always smiling but could not recreate it even if I tried. Why was it so timid? Void of all expression? One glance and a person could tell something was lost in that smile. Lost throughout the years of pain that slowly deteriorated that picturesque smile. I stood in silence. Unable to speak because of the utter shock of what I was seeing. </p>
                        <p>20 years. 20 years on this earth. Living in the same body. Fulfilling the same routine that proposed itself every day. But this is the first time I had noticed it. I didn’t recognize this person. I knew it was me, but once again, I could see I had changed. I knew I was drowning and as every day passed, the water kept getting deeper and harder to swim in. I couldn’t break the surface. The tide of change had swept me away like a vague memory now forgotten. But this was the first time. The realization that I had lost myself somewhere along the way. As the emotions faded, I now realized that the person I had known was gone. I couldn’t revert to the person I once was. I couldn’t turn back time. I couldn’t live in the past. But with that recognition, came acceptance. All this time I was battling the current, but I finally understood that I couldn’t fight the tide. The only constant is change, and I couldn’t ignore that fact any longer. Looking back at the mirror, I knew I needed to act. It was time to change, but change on my terms. </p>
